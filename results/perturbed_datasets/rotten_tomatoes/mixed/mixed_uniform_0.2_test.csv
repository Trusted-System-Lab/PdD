the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .,0
"rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world .",0
mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls .,0
"it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it .",0
"i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles .",0
the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters .,0
"some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .",0
"the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .",0
this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head,0
"the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .",0
"spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .",0
"it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .",0
a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .,0
the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess .,0
"proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .",0
"did we really need a remake of "" charade ? """,0
"some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .",0
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .,0
i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits,0
"entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .",0
the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .,0
bearable . barely .,0
less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .,0
"an "" o bruin , where art thou ? "" -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .",0
a feeble tootsie knockoff .,0
an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .,0
"the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .",0
the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .,0
"an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .",0
"a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .",0
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .,0
"essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality",0
"a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .",0
[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through .,0
"too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .",0
leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .,0
". . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .",0
swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell .,0
"the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .",0
you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .,0
"diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .",0
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .,0
"an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .",0
it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .,0
absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying .,0
eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring .,0
eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof .,0
"no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way .",0
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .,0
"'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .",0
"in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .",0
"blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .",0
veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda .,0
staggeringly dreadful romance .,0
movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ?,0
final verdict : you've seen it all before .,0
"throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material .",0
"if a few good men told us that we "" can't handle the truth "" than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we "" don't care about the truth . """,0
"further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .",0
you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .,0
the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .,0
this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .,0
a full-frontal attack on audience patience .,0
"any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors .",0
"it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .",0
"debut effort by "" project greenlight "" winner is sappy and amateurish .",0
one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny .,0
"the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .",0
"the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs .",0
"the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies .",0
"purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too .",0
. . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .,0
"though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected .",0
well-made but mush-hearted .,0
humor in i spy is so anemic .,0
the film is strictly routine .,0
a real snooze .,0
"skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .",0
"while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier .",0
"in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .",0
"it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .",0
"the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down .",0
you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .,0
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .,0
"if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid .",0
we get the comedy we settle for .,0
the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .,0
two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .,0
"a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are .",0
the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated .,0
its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists .,0
the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .,0
cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film .,0
"manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .",0
"hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing .",0
"true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .",0
doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .,0
the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .,0
kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .,0
"the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .",0
queen of the damned is too long with too little going on .,0
it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush .,0
"any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .",0
". . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .",0
the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .,0
"though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .",0
"in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .",0
feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .,0
no surprises .,0
"you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .",0
"the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view .",0
this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .,0
characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .,0
"the venezuelans say things like "" si , pretty much "" and "" por favor , go home "" when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of "" dragonfly . """,0
"it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will .",0
director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .,0
"it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .",0
"like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on",0
as pedestrian as they come .,0
a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .,0
"it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .",0
"put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work .",0
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving .,0
"an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .",0
"the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here .",0
as saccharine as it is disposable .,0
"you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .",0
"the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .",0
"very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .",0
"too much power , not enough puff .",0
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .,0
"it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .",0
"a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .",0
"muddled , trashy and incompetent",0
"for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league .",0
narc is all menace and atmosphere .,0
"though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .",0
"despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .",0
it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing .,0
"his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .",0
it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .,0
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .,0
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .,0
"as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .",0
the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .,0
"enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .",0
