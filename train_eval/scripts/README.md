<h1>Training</h1>
Run the clean training first to train a clean model as a base model for adversarial training.

We now have another hyper parameter, num of perturbations, which controls how many perturbed samples should be generated for each sample.

Follow bert-based-uncased-rotten-tomatoes-deletion.py to create your own script for other perturbation type training. Create a bash script to run the training for different parameters combinations.
